The port we used was 51020, which was Andrew's assigned port for the 
other project

We made some changes since the pdf file to the way we are doing the 
webservice. The slight changes are that we added a reset url and added a 
scaled url to differentiate the scaled to earth version with the normal 
version of getting a planet. 

Otherwise we formatted the webservice similarly to the cherrypy project. 
We decided to make everything within one controller because there is a 
small enough scope of different features that we feel that they fit 
naturally together in one file. 

We used a different url for the reset to 
allow us to make it more intuitive for the user as opposed to using a 
normal post. We used a different url for the scaled because we have to 
differentiate the different get requests

The server maps pretty directly to the functions from the API so none of 
the handler functions are overly complex.
